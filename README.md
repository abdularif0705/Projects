# hello-world
Was good fam.

I'm a second year student at the University of Windsor. I'm pursuing a double major Bachelor of Commerce (Honours Business Administration and Computer Science). I'm looking to improve my skills and land a succesful job in which I'll be able to make an impact on the world.
